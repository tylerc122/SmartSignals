# Training Configuration

# Environment Settings
environment:
  name: "SingleIntersection"
  sumo_config: "sumo_scenarios/single_intersection.sumocfg"
  episode_length: 3600 # seconds (1 hour simulation)
  step_size: 5 # SUMO simulation step size in seconds

# RL Algorithm Configuration
algorithm:
  name: "PPO" # Proximal Policy Optimization, a type of RL algorithm, gradual improvements, good for continuous actions
  learning_rate: 0.0003 # How fast the agent learns (smaller = more stable) standard for PPO algo
  total_timesteps: 100000 # Total training steps i.e how long to train the AI
  batch_size: 64 # Number of experiences processed at once i.e how many experiences to process together
  n_epochs: 10 # Training epochs per update i.e how many times to repaly teh same batch of experiences, too low and no learning too much and overfitting

# Neural Network Architecture
network:
  policy_layers: [64, 64] # Hidden layers for the policy network
  value_layers: [64, 64] # Hidden layers for the value network
  activation: "tanh" # Activation function, non-linearity, the "thinking" part of the AI

# Reward Function Parameters
rewards:
  waiting_time_penalty: -1.0 # Penalty per second of vehicle waiting
  throughput_reward: 0.1 # Reward per vehicle that passes through
  queue_length_penalty: -0.1 # Penalty per vehicle in queue

# Training Schedule
training:
  save_frequency: 10000 # Save model every N timesteps, checkpoint
  eval_frequency: 5000 # Evaluate model every N timesteps
  log_frequency: 1000 # Log metrics every N timesteps

# Evaluation Settings
evaluation:
  episodes: 10 # Number of episodes for evaluation
  render: false # Whether to visualize during evaluation
